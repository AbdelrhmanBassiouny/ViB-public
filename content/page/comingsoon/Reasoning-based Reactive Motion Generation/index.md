This virtual research lab explores reactive motion generation through reasoning. We propose image schema-based reasoning for decision-making within motion controllers. Our reasoner is tightly coupled with the controller, continuously monitoring actions and inferring motion primitives to adapt to dynamic environments. By providing real-time feedback, the reasoner enables the controller to make informed decisions and generate appropriate motion responses.
