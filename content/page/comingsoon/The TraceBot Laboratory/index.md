The TraceBot Lab offers a pioneering platform for conducting research with robotic
systems uniquely designed to have a profound understanding of their actions and
perceptions, specifically targeting the automation of the membrane-based sterility
testing process. At the heart of the TraceBot Lab’s mission is the integration of
verifiable actions into robotic manipulations, facilitated by advanced reasoning over
sensor-actor trails within a comprehensive traceability framework. This framework
capitalizes on digital-twin technology, which serves to replicate the physical world
within a virtual environment, enhancing robot motion planners with the ability to
autonomously execute self-checking procedures. These innovative procedures aim to
create a semantic trace of the robot’s actions, ensuring that every manipulation is not
only verifiable but also meets the rigorous standards required in regulated
environments like healthcare. Through this approach, the TraceBot Lab is setting
new benchmarks for the reliability and accountability of robotic systems in critical
sectors.
