The lecture course ”Robot Programming with ROS” offers an immersive and
practical approach to learning the intricacies of programming robots using the Robot
Operating System (ROS). Set within the innovative context of virtual research
building laboratories, this course provides students with a unique opportunity to
apply theoretical concepts in a simulated real-world environment. The course
materials, including exercise sheets and programming environments, are readily
accessible on GitHub, allowing students to dive into practical, hands-on exercises
that significantly enhance their learning experience. This deliberate integration of
practical examples into the curriculum is designed to seamlessly connect theoretical
knowledge with real-world application, equipping students with the necessary skills
and confidence to tackle the challenges of robot programming in various professional
settings. Through this course, learners are not just exposed to the fundamentals of
ROS but are also prepared to navigate and innovate within the evolving landscape of
robotics technology.
