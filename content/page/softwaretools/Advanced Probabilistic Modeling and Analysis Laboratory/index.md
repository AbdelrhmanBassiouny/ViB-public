In our Advanced Probabilistic Modeling and Analysis Laboratory, we focus on the
innovative use of Joint Probability Trees (JPTs), a formalism that facilitates the
learning and reasoning of joint probability distributions in a tractable manner for
practical applications. JPTs are distinctive for their capability to incorporate both
symbolic and subsymbolic variables within a unified hybrid model, without
necessitating prior knowledge about variable dependencies or specific distribution
families. Within the context of our Virtual Research Building, JPTs are employed to
construct and analyze joint probability distributions derived from log data of robot
experiments. This enables us to critically evaluate experimental outcomes and
harness robot experience data for learning purposes, paving the way for
advancements in robot performance and decision-making processes.
